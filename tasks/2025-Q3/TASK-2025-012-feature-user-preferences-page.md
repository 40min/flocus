## Description
This task covers the full-stack implementation to refactor the user settings page. It involves removing deprecated UI components, adding new user preference settings ("Pomodoro timeout" and "System notifications"), and implementing the backend infrastructure to persist these settings within the user's profile in the database.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A user can log in, navigate to `/settings`, change their Pomodoro and notification settings, and save them.
- Upon reloading the page, the user's new settings are correctly pre-populated in the form.
- All new and updated backend unit/integration tests for the user model, service, and API endpoint pass successfully.
- All new and updated frontend tests for the `UserSettingsPage` component pass successfully.
- The new feature is fully type-safe from the database model to the frontend components.

## Definition of Done
- All child tasks (`TASK-2025-013`, `TASK-2025-014`) are completed.
- Backend code is written, tested, and merged.
- Frontend code is written, tested, and merged.
- The `ARCH-feature-user-preferences` architecture document status is updated to `current`.
