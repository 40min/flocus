## Context
This document outlines the planned architecture for storing and managing user-specific preferences, such as Pomodoro timeouts and system notification settings. The goal is to provide a persistent, centralized storage mechanism for these settings.

## Structure
The implementation will involve changes across the full stack:

- **Data Model (`backend/db/models/user.py`):**
  - A new `UserPreferences` embedded model will be introduced to hold user-specific settings.
  - The `User` model will be updated with a new `preferences: UserPreferences` field, with a default factory to ensure backward compatibility.

- **API Schemas (`backend/app/api/schemas/user.py`):**
  - A `UserPreferencesSchema` will be created to define the data contract for API requests.
  - `UserUpdateRequest` and `UserResponse` schemas will be updated to include the new `preferences` object.

- **Backend Service (`backend/app/services/user_service.py`):**
  - The `update_user_by_id` method will be modified to handle the logic of updating the nested `preferences` object within the `User` model.

- **Frontend Types (`frontend/src/types/user.ts`):**
  - A new `UserPreferences` interface will mirror the backend schema.
  - The main `User` interface will be updated to include the `preferences` field.

- **Frontend Component (`frontend/src/pages/UserSettingsPage.tsx`):**
  - The settings page will be refactored to remove hardcoded, deprecated settings ("Dark Mode", "Default View").
  - New form elements for "Pomodoro timeout" and "System notifications" will be added, managed by `react-hook-form`.

## Behavior
The system will follow this sequence to update user preferences:

1.  A user modifies settings on the `/settings` page in the frontend.
2.  The `UserSettingsPage` component dispatches an update action with the new preferences payload.
3.  The frontend `userService` sends a `PUT /api/v1/users/{id}` request to the backend.
4.  The backend `UserService` receives the request and updates the nested `preferences` sub-document for the specified user in the MongoDB `users` collection.
5.  The updated `User` object, including the new preferences, is returned to the frontend and reflected in the application's state.

## Evolution
### Planned
- v1: Initial implementation of Pomodoro timeout and system notification preferences.
