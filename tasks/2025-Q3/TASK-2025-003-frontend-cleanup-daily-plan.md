## Description
This task involves updating the frontend data layer to match the backend API changes (removal of the `reviewed` field) and refactoring the `SelfReflectionComponent` to be a controlled component, decoupling its state management from its presentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Task 2.1: Update Frontend Type Definition:** The `reviewed` property is removed from the `DailyPlanResponse` interface in `frontend/src/types/dailyPlan.ts`.
- **Task 2.2: Refactor SelfReflectionComponent:** The component in `frontend/src/components/SelfReflectionComponent.tsx` is modified to remove its internal "Save" button and `onSave` prop. It now communicates state changes up to its parent via a new `onReflectionChange` callback.

## Definition of Done
- Code changes are implemented as per the acceptance criteria.
- All related frontend tests pass.

## Notes
Depends on the completion of the backend task `TASK-2025-002`.
