## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    *   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework.
    *   **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Python:** A high-level, general-purpose programming language.
    *   **FastAPI:** A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ (with type hints).
    *   **Pydantic:** A data validation and settings management library.
    *   **Odmantic:** An asynchronous ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for MongoDB based on Pydantic models.
    *   **Uvicorn:** An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
*   **Database:**
    *   **MongoDB:** A NoSQL document database.
*   **Other:**
    *   **REST API:** Architectural style for communication between frontend and backend.
    *   **JSON:** Data-interchange format.
    *   **Docker:** Containerization platform (for development, testing, and potentially deployment).

## Software Development Tools

*   **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with relevant extensions (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Python, TypeScript).
*   **Version Control:** Git (using GitHub for remote repository).
*   **Package Manager:**
    *   **Frontend:** npm (Node Package Manager)
    *   **Backend:** Poetry (Python dependency management and packaging)
*   **API Client:** Bruno (API client for testing and exploring APIs).
*   **Database Management:** MongoDB Compass (GUI for MongoDB).
*   **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose.

## Development Environment

*   **Operating System:** macOS (primary development environment).
*   **Python Version:** 3.9+
*   **Node.js Version:** 16+ (compatible with React and npm).
*   **MongoDB:** Locally installed MongoDB instance (or Dockerized MongoDB).
*   **Dependencies:** All project dependencies are managed through `package.json` (frontend) and `pyproject.toml` (backend using Poetry). Poetry manages virtual environments automatically.
*   **Configuration:** Environment variables are used to manage application configuration (e.g., API endpoint URLs, database connection strings). `.env` files (ignored by Git) are used for local development.

## Testing Strategy

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Jest and React Testing Library for testing individual components and functions.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Testing the interaction between components.
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Future):** Cypress or similar tools for testing the entire application flow.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** pytest for testing individual functions and classes.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Testing the interaction between different modules.
    *   **API Tests:** Testing API endpoints using pytest and a dedicated testing library (e.g., `requests`).
*   **Database Tests:** Testing database interactions using mock data or a dedicated test database.
*   **Code Coverage:** Tools like `coverage.py` (Python) and Jest's built-in coverage reports (JavaScript) are used to measure test coverage.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Encouraged where applicable.

## Deployment Process

*   **Target Environment:** Initially, the application will be deployed to a local server or a development/staging environment.
*   **Deployment Method:**
    *   **Backend:** Potentially using a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) with containerization (Docker). Deployment scripts will automate the process of building, packaging, and deploying the backend application.
    *   **Frontend:** Hosting the static assets on a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or a static website hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
*   **Configuration Management:** Environment variables will be used to configure the application in the target environment.
*   **Monitoring:** Basic monitoring will be implemented to track application health and performance. Tools like Prometheus and Grafana may be considered for more advanced monitoring in the future.
*   **Rollback Strategy:** A rollback strategy will be defined to quickly revert to a previous version of the application in case of issues.

## Continuous Integration Approach

*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions will be used to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
*   **Workflow Triggers:** The CI/CD pipeline will be triggered on code commits to the main branch (and potentially on pull requests).
*   **Pipeline Stages:**
    *   **Build:** Building the frontend and backend applications.
    *   **Test:** Running unit, integration, and API tests.
    *   **Code Analysis:** Performing static code analysis using linters (e.g., ESLint, pylint) and code formatters (e.g., Prettier, black).
    *   **Deployment (Future):** Deploying the application to the target environment (after successful tests and code analysis).
*   **Notifications:** Notifications will be sent to the team on pipeline failures.
