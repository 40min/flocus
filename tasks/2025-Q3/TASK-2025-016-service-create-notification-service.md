## Description
Create the `NotificationService` file and implement its core functions (`requestPermission` and `showNotification`) to abstract the browser's Web Notification API.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The file `frontend/src/services/notificationService.ts` is created.
- The `requestPermission` function is implemented and correctly handles all three permission states ('granted', 'denied', 'default').
- The `showNotification(title, options)` function is implemented. It should accept an `icon` in its options and use it for the notification.

## Definition of Done
- The `notificationService.ts` module is created and its functions are fully implemented as per the architecture.
