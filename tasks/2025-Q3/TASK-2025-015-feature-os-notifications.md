## Description
This plan outlines the steps to implement operating system-level notifications for completed Pomodoro timers and breaks. The notification will include the name of the task that was just being worked on, if applicable. This feature will be contingent on both user preferences within the application and browser-level notification permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- When a work timer finishes, an OS notification appears stating "Work session finished!" and mentioning the active task, provided notifications are enabled by the user and permitted by the browser.
- When a break timer finishes, an OS notification appears stating "Break's over!", under the same conditions.
- No notifications are shown if the user has disabled them in the app's settings page.
- All new and updated unit tests pass.

## Definition of Done
- All child tasks are completed and their `status` is `done`.
- The feature is implemented and tested as per the plan.
- The `ARCH-feature-os-notifications` and `ARCH-service-notification` architecture documents are updated to `status: current`.

## Notes
- This is a planned feature. Implementation will follow the child tasks.
