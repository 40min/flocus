# Frontend Testing Strategy

## 1. Goal
Establish and document a formal testing strategy for the frontend project. This document will serve as a guide for all future testing efforts, ensuring consistency and clarity.

## 2. Testing Pyramid

### Unit Tests
-   **Purpose:** To test individual, isolated functions or small modules.
-   **Targets:** Utility functions (`src/lib/utils.ts`), service functions (`src/services/*.ts`).
-   **Tools:** Jest.
-   **Approach:** Mock all external dependencies to ensure true isolation.

### Integration Tests
-   **Purpose:** To test the interaction between multiple units or components.
-   **Targets:** React components (`src/components`, `src/pages`), custom hooks (`src/hooks`).
-   **Tools:** React Testing Library, Jest.
-   **Approach:** Render components and interact with them as a user would. Mock API calls and service layer interactions.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests
-   **Purpose:** To simulate real user scenarios across the entire application.
-   **Targets:** Critical user flows (e.g., login, task creation, daily plan management).
-   **Tools:** (Future consideration: Cypress, Playwright).
-   **Approach:** Test the application as a black box, interacting with the UI and verifying outcomes.

## 3. Testing Targets

### Services (`src/services`)
-   All public functions within service files should have comprehensive unit tests.
-   Focus on business logic and data manipulation.

### Hooks (`src/hooks`)
-   Custom hooks with complex logic or state management should be tested using React Testing Library's `renderHook` utility.

### Components (`src/components`, `src/pages`)
-   Critical and complex components should have integration tests.
-   Tests should cover user interactions, state changes, and rendering of props.
-   Aim for high coverage of user-facing functionality.

## 4. Key Considerations & Risk Mitigation
-   **Technical Risks & Challenges:** No significant technical risks, as this task primarily involves documentation.
-   **Dependencies:** This document is a prerequisite for subsequent testing tasks (`05-02-service-layer-tests.md`, `05-03-critical-component-tests.md`).

## 5. Success Metrics / Validation Criteria
-   The file `frontend/TESTING.md` is created and committed to the repository.
-   The content of the file matches the specification in this plan.
-   The development team has a clear, documented reference for the project's testing strategy.

## 6. Assumptions Made
-   The testing pyramid is the appropriate model for this project.
-   The chosen tools (Jest, React Testing Library) are approved for use.
-   The defined testing targets (services, hooks, components) are the correct initial focus.

## 7. Open Questions / Areas for Further Investigation
-   None for this task. The strategy is well-defined in the source task document.
