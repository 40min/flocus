# Active Context: Personal Scheduler Application

This document outlines the active context for the Personal Scheduler application project. It serves as a snapshot of the current sprint, ongoing tasks, known issues, priorities, next steps, and recent meeting notes.

## Sprint Goals (Sprint 1: Project Setup)

The primary goals for this sprint (Sprint 1) are:

*   **Set up project architecture:** Establish the foundational architecture with decoupled frontend and backend components connected via REST API.

## Sprint Goals (Sprint 2: Focused Productivity)

The primary goals for this sprint (Sprint 2) are:

*   **Implement Core Scheduling Functionality:**  Allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks with defined start and end times, descriptions, and priority levels.
*   **Basic UI Integration:**  Connect the React frontend to the FastAPI backend for task CRUD operations. Users should be able to interact with the scheduler through the UI.
*   **Data Persistence:** Ensure tasks are persistently stored in MongoDB and correctly retrieved upon application restart.
*   **Basic Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling in both the frontend and backend to provide informative feedback to the user and prevent application crashes.

## Ongoing Tasks

*   [ ] Implement daily planning functionality - *Assigned to: All*
*   [ ] Implement Pomodoro technique functionality - *Assigned to: All*
*   [ ] Develop time tracking features - *Assigned to: All*
*   [ ] Implement self-reflection and notes functionality - *Assigned to: All*

## Known Issues


## Priorities

1.  **Core Scheduling Functionality (CRUD):**  This is the highest priority.  All tasks related to implementing the basic task CRUD operations in both the frontend and backend should be prioritized.
2.  **Data Persistence (MongoDB):** Ensuring data is correctly stored and retrieved is crucial.
3.  **Basic UI Integration:** Connecting the frontend and backend is essential for user interaction.
4.  **Backend Error Handling:** Preventing application crashes and providing informative error messages is important for usability.
5.  **Frontend Error Handling:** Providing feedback to the user in the event of an error.
