# Timer State Fixes

## Issue 1: Timer State Persistence (RESOLVED)

When a user starts a task, the timer starts ticking and the button updates to show "In progress". However, if the user reloads the browser page, all of this state is lost and the task appears as if it was never started.

## Issue 2: Break Mode Task Unassignment (RESOLVED)

When timer switches to "break" state it unassigns a task (this shouldn't happen), after this user is able to click "start" (wrong, in "break" mode user shouldn't be able to start any task, only controls on timer should be active).

## Root Cause

The timer state persistence had several issues:

1. Timer continuation logic wasn't properly handling elapsed time during page absence
2. Timer always started paused on reload, losing the "active" state
3. No proper handling of timer expiration during absence
4. Redundant state restoration logic causing conflicts

## Solution 1 - Frontend-Only Persistence Approach (RESOLVED)

Instead of relying on backend task status (which can be unreliable since multiple tasks can be "in_progress"), we implemented a robust frontend-only persistence solution using Zustand's persist middleware with custom restoration logic.

## Solution 2 - Break Mode Task Retention (RESOLVED)

Fixed the timer behavior during break modes to maintain task assignment and prevent inappropriate task starting during breaks.

### Key Principles:

1. **Timer state is frontend-only**: The timer represents a focus session, not a backend task state
2. **Reliable persistence**: All timer state (task info, time remaining, active status) is saved to localStorage
3. **Smart restoration**: On page reload, calculate elapsed time and handle timer continuation intelligently
4. **Seamless continuation**: Preserves active state and continues running if timer was active before reload

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Zustand Persist Configuration (`frontend/src/stores/timerStore.ts`)

- Added custom `onRehydrateStorage` logic for intelligent state restoration
- Handles timer continuation by calculating elapsed time during absence
- Manages timer expiration gracefully (resets timer but keeps task)
- Always restores in paused state for user control

### 2. Removed Backend Dependencies

- Removed `syncTimerWithBackend()` function
- Removed backend task status checking from initialization
- Simplified `initializeTimer()` to be purely frontend-focused

### 3. Improved State Management

- Enhanced `clearTimerState()` for proper cleanup
- Better timestamp handling for accurate time calculations
- Proper user preferences integration for timer durations

### 4. Updated Tests

- Removed backend-dependent tests
- Added tests for frontend-only persistence
- Tests for state clearing and restoration

## How It Works Now

### Starting a Task:

1. ✅ Timer state updated locally (task info, time remaining, active status)
2. ✅ Task status updated to "in_progress" in backend (for task management)
3. ✅ All state automatically persisted to localStorage

### Page Reload:

1. ✅ Zustand persist middleware restores state from localStorage
2. ✅ Custom restoration logic calculates elapsed time
3. ✅ If timer was active and time remains: restore with correct remaining time (continues running)
4. ✅ If timer expired during absence: reset timer but keep task attached
5. ✅ If too much time passed (>1 hour): reset everything for fresh start

### Result:

- ✅ Task information preserved across reloads
- ✅ Timer shows correct remaining time after calculating elapsed time
- ✅ Timer continues running seamlessly if it was active before reload
- ✅ Handles edge cases (expiration, long absence) gracefully

## Benefits of Frontend-Only Approach

1. **Reliability**: No dependency on backend task status which can be inconsistent
2. **Performance**: No additional API calls on app initialization
3. **Simplicity**: Single source of truth for timer state
4. **Flexibility**: Timer can work independently of task management system
5. **User Experience**: Consistent behavior regardless of backend state

## Testing

Run the timer store tests to verify the fix:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test -- --testPathPattern=timerStore.test.ts --watchAll=false
```

All tests should pass, confirming the robust frontend-only persistence works correctly.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Quick Reload (< 1 minute)

- Start 25-minute timer, 20 minutes remaining
- Reload page after 30 seconds
- Result: Timer shows 19:30 remaining, continues running seamlessly

### Scenario 2: Timer Expires During Absence

- Start 25-minute timer, 2 minutes remaining
- Close browser for 10 minutes
- Result: Timer reset to 25:00, task still attached, ready for new session

### Scenario 3: Long Absence (> 1 hour)

- Start timer, close browser for 2 hours
- Result: Complete reset to default state for fresh start
