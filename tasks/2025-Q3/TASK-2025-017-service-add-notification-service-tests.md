## Description
Add unit tests for the new `NotificationService` to ensure reliability and correct permission handling under various conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A new test file `frontend/src/services/notificationService.test.ts` is created.
- The global `Notification` object is mocked to allow for testing without actual browser prompts.
- Tests cover all three permission states ('granted', 'denied', 'default') for both `requestPermission` and `showNotification` functions.
