## Description
Request notification permission from the user on initial application load. This provides a standard, one-time prompt for a better user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A `useEffect` hook in `frontend/src/App.tsx` calls `notificationService.requestPermission()` on component mount.
- The permission is requested only once per session.
