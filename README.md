# Personal Scheduler Application

A "personal scheduler" application designed to help software engineers plan their workday effectively. The application will be used locally on macOS, with the potential for future extension to different clients. It features a decoupled frontend (React, TypeScript, Tailwind) and backend (Python/FastAPI) interacting through a REST API. Data will be stored in MongoDB.
