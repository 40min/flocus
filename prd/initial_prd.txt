A project of “personal scheduler” for planning of workday of software engineer. The application will be used locally on macOS, should have a GUI, but it should be possible to extend it for use with different clients, so it should have FE and BE parts decoupled and interacting through a REST API.

**Features:**

- User can create a custom template of a day split into categorized time windows. For example:
    - **Tasks**
        - **Lookup: 25m**
        - **Daily routines:**
            - Hotkeys/shortcuts
            - New features in …
            - Read an article
        - **Learning:**
        - **Development:**
        - **Software setup:**
        - **Tech radar:**
        - **Try to build:**
- Every time window category could have an adjustable time interval.
- Every new working day is created based on these time windows, but the size of the time window for an exact day can be adjusted individually.
- Windows are filled from:
    - Non-completed tasks from the previous day
    - A categorized heap of new tasks
- There should be a separate page for adding a new task to pick next.
- The app should use the Pomodoro approach with adjustable time intervals. Based on “clear time” (excluding rest time), the amount of new tasks should be planned.
- The page for the working day should have other useful sections:
    - **Time Tracking**
        - **Overall available:** time of a day excluding time for rest
        - **Lacking:** it is possible to take more tasks than the working day allows; in this case, this parameter of the day should be positive in hours and minutes
        - **Missing:** if the user gets distracted during work, they can take a pause and resume working. Missing time is the difference between start/stop working excluding rest time. Example: the difference between stop/start is one hour, and according to Pomodoro, the user should have two 5-minute pauses. In this case, “missing time” is 50m
        - **Stopped:** time of starting a distraction pause
    - **Target:** chosen target task of the day
    - **Notes for tomorrow**
    - **“How do I feel”: self-reflection section (filled for the previous day every morning)**
        - **Bad/Problems**
        - **Good**
