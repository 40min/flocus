# Project Brief: Personal Scheduler Application

## Project Purpose and Vision

A "personal scheduler" application designed to help software engineers plan their workday effectively. The application will be used locally on macOS, with the potential for future extension to different clients. It features a decoupled frontend (React, TypeScript, Tailwind) and backend (Python/FastAPI) interacting through a REST API. Data will be stored in MongoDB.

## Main Objectives

*   **Develop a functional and user-friendly personal scheduler application for macOS.** This includes a robust backend API and a responsive frontend interface.
*   **Provide a clear and intuitive interface for task management.** The application should be easy to learn and use, minimizing the learning curve for new users.
*   **Enable efficient scheduling and prioritization of tasks.** Users should be able to easily create, edit, prioritize, and track tasks.
*   **Provide customizable notifications and reminders.** Users should be able to set reminders for tasks and appointments to stay on track.
*   **Implement a decoupled architecture for maintainability and future scalability.** The frontend and backend should communicate via a well-defined REST API.
*   **Ensure data persistence and reliability through MongoDB integration.** Data should be securely stored and easily accessible.

## Target Audience

The primary target audience for this application is software engineers. This includes:

*   Individual developers
*   Team leads
*   Project managers who are also involved in coding
*   Any software professional seeking a more effective way to manage their time and tasks.

The application will be designed with the specific needs and challenges of this audience in mind, focusing on features that directly improve their daily workflow.

## Key Features

*   **Task Management:**
    *   Create, edit, and delete tasks with descriptions, deadlines, and priorities.
    *   Categorize tasks using tags or labels.
    *   Mark tasks as complete.
*   **Prioritization:**
    *   Assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
    *   Filter and sort tasks by priority.
*   **Notifications and Reminders:**
    *   Set customizable reminders for tasks and appointments.
    *   Receive notifications through the macOS notification center.
*   **Reporting and Analytics (Future Enhancement):**
    *   Track time spent on tasks.
    *   Generate reports on productivity and time management.
*   **User Authentication (Future Enhancement):**
    *   Secure user accounts.
*   **Search:**
    *   Search tasks by name, description, or tag.

## Success Criteria

The success of this project will be measured by the following criteria:

*   **Functionality:** All key features are implemented and function as expected.
*   **Usability:** The application is easy to use and intuitive, as demonstrated through user testing.
*   **Performance:** The application is responsive and performs efficiently.
*   **Stability:** The application is stable and reliable, with minimal bugs or crashes.
*   **Code Quality:** The codebase is well-structured, maintainable, and adheres to best practices.
*   **Adoption:** Targeted users actively use the application to manage their daily schedules.
*   **Completion within Budget and Timeline:** The project is completed within the allocated budget and timeline.

## Realistic Timeline

The project is estimated to take approximately 12 weeks to complete, broken down as follows:

*   **Week 1-2: Project Setup & Backend API Design:** Define API endpoints, database schema, and initial backend framework.
*   **Week 3-4: Backend Development (FastAPI & MongoDB Integration):** Implement core backend functionality, including task management and scheduling endpoints.
*   **Week 5-6: Frontend Development (React & TypeScript):** Set up the frontend framework and develop basic UI components.
*   **Week 7-8: Frontend-Backend Integration:** Connect the frontend to the backend API and implement data flow.
*   **Week 9-10: Feature Implementation & Testing:** Implement remaining features and conduct thorough testing.
*   **Week 11: Bug Fixing & Refinement:** Address any identified bugs and refine the application based on testing feedback.
*   **Week 12: Documentation & Release:** Finalize documentation and prepare the application for initial release.
